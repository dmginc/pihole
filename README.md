Made this update and share my adlists.list and whitelist files with the gusys.

Feel free to replace (or merge?) your /etc/pihole/whitelist and /etc/pihole/adlists.list files with these.  The adlists.list file changes rarely, but the whitelist is obviously more fluid.

90% of the whitelist file comes from the <a href="https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/commonly-whitelisted-domains/212">Commonly Whitelisted Domains</a> wiki.  The other 10% comes from me tinkering around.

The adlists.list file is a combination (currently) of the default lists and <a href="https://wally3k.github.io/">wally3k's</a> custom lists.  I only use his 'ticked' lists, which he says should be free of any false positives, but that isn't always the case (thus the extensive whitelist).
